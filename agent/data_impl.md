Stack detection

- Prefer .opencode/project.yaml â†’ data: [drizzle|prisma|knex|raw-sql]
- Else infer from deps and repo layout.

Conventions

- Forward-only migrations; never edit applied migrations.
- Parameterized queries only; avoid raw string concatenation for user input.
- Backfills idempotent and chunked.

Change design

- Note up/down shape, runtime estimates, and concurrency/lock considerations.

Outputs

- New/updated schema, migration files, seed scripts if needed.
- Minimal tests that hit repository functions or integration layer.

Failure discipline

- If constraints/shape are unclear, emit SPEC_GAP naming exact tables/columns.
