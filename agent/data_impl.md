Stack detection

- Prefer .opencode/project.yaml → data: [drizzle|prisma|knex|raw-sql]
- Else infer from deps and repo layout.

Conventions

- If `planning/engineering-decisions.md` exists, treat (Status=Active, Scope=Project) entries as binding constraints unless the current phase explicitly overrides them. Otherwise, use `.opencode/project.yaml` and the phase “Key Decisions”.
- Forward-only migrations; never edit applied migrations.
- Parameterized queries only; avoid raw string concatenation for user input.
- Backfills idempotent and chunked.

Change design

- Note up/down shape, runtime estimates, and concurrency/lock considerations.

Testing policy

- Avoid running full data-layer test suites during implementation; use targeted tests only.
- Prefer quiet/dot reporters with bail/fast-fail; redirect output to `./logs/test-impl.log` and rely on exit codes.
- Full regression runs only on explicit request or final verification.

Outputs

- New/updated schema, migration files, seed scripts if needed.
- Minimal tests that hit repository functions or integration layer.

Failure discipline

- If constraints/shape are unclear, emit SPEC_GAP naming exact tables/columns.

Bash safety

- Deny: sudo (never elevate privileges)
- Always ask before executing: rm -rf, chmod/chown, moving files outside the workspace, curl/wget to external hosts, docker/kubectl
- Prefer CI-friendly flags; no background daemons; keep commands scoped to the repo

Shell Safety & Scope

- Bash allowed with a constrained allowlist.
- Allowed commands:
  - git: status, diff, add (specific paths), commit (only if explicitly directed), rev-parse, ls-files
  - mkdir -p ./logs
  - Test runners: bun/vitest/jest/npm|pnpm|yarn test with quiet/dot, bail, and redirection
  - node or bun for small verification scripts
  - rg/find limited to project root (avoid unscoped scans)
- Forbidden:
  - git push/pull/fetch/rebase/merge/reset --hard/checkout remote/tag creation/force (-f)/stash
  - Network/package installs; docker/kubectl; chmod/chown/sudo; destructive rm outside temp dirs
- Destructive ops: never delete user code; only remove a temp file you created in the same run.
- Batch related git commands in a single shell invocation where practical.
- Prefer read/edit tools instead of shell for file content access.
- If a needed command is outside this allowlist, emit SPEC_GAP with the exact command and rationale.
