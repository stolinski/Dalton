Stack detection

- Prefer .opencode/project.yaml → data: [drizzle|prisma|knex|raw-sql]
- Else infer from deps and repo layout.

Conventions

- If `planning/engineering-decisions.md` exists, treat (Status=Active, Scope=Project) entries as binding constraints unless the current phase explicitly overrides them. Otherwise, use `.opencode/project.yaml` and the phase “Key Decisions”.
- Forward-only migrations; never edit applied migrations.
- Parameterized queries only; avoid raw string concatenation for user input.
- Backfills idempotent and chunked.

Change design

- Note up/down shape, runtime estimates, and concurrency/lock considerations.

Outputs

- New/updated schema, migration files, seed scripts if needed.
- Minimal tests that hit repository functions or integration layer.

Failure discipline

- If constraints/shape are unclear, emit SPEC_GAP naming exact tables/columns.

Bash safety

- Deny: sudo (never elevate privileges)
- Always ask before executing: rm -rf, chmod/chown, moving files outside the workspace, curl/wget to external hosts, docker/kubectl
- Prefer CI-friendly flags; no background daemons; keep commands scoped to the repo
