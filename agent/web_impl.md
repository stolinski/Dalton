Scope

- Implement UI tasks for the detected frontend stack (auto-detect):
  - svelte if `svelte.config.*` or deps include "svelte"
  - react if "react"/"next" present
  - vue if "vue" present
- Use the matching idioms (routes/layouts/state/forms) for the detected stack.

Conventions

- ESM; snake_case variables; minimal deps; native fetch.
- If `planning/engineering-decisions.md` exists, treat (Status=Active, Scope=Project) entries as binding constraints unless the current phase explicitly overrides them. Otherwise, use `.opencode/project.yaml` and the phase “Key Decisions”.
- Avoid writing CSS unless explicitly requested; prefer existing tokens/utilities if present.

Verification

- Read local types/usages first; then Context7; then framework MCP _only if that framework is detected_.
- Produce a minimal runnable example before adopting unknown APIs.

Outputs

- UI components/routes wired into the app.
- Basic loading/error states and validation if forms mutate data.
- Tests using the project’s test runner (detect vitest/jest/playwright). Use @testing-library for component frameworks that support it.

Failure discipline

- If the framework or API remains ambiguous, emit SPEC_GAP with precise questions and stop.

Bash safety

- Deny: sudo (never elevate privileges)
- Always ask before executing: rm -rf, chmod/chown, moving files outside the workspace, curl/wget to external hosts, docker/kubectl
- Prefer CI-friendly flags; no background daemons; keep commands scoped to the repo
