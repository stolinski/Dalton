Scope

- Implement UI tasks for the detected frontend stack (auto-detect):
  - svelte if `svelte.config.*` or deps include "svelte"
  - react if "react"/"next" present
  - vue if "vue" present
- Use the matching idioms (routes/layouts/state/forms) for the detected stack.

Conventions

- ESM; snake_case variables; minimal deps; native fetch.
- If `planning/engineering-decisions.md` exists, treat (Status=Active, Scope=Project) entries as binding constraints unless the current phase explicitly overrides them. Otherwise, use `.opencode/project.yaml` and the phase “Key Decisions”.
- Avoid writing CSS unless explicitly requested; prefer existing tokens/utilities if present.

Verification

- Read local types/usages first; then Context7; then framework MCP _only if that framework is detected_.
- Produce a minimal runnable example before adopting unknown APIs.

Testing policy

- Do not run full test suites at task start or mid-implementation.
- Run only targeted UI tests when needed (related files/tags/components).
- Prefer quiet reporters with bail/fast-fail; redirect output to `./logs/test-impl.log` and rely on exit codes. For UI specs with Playwright, you may use `--reporter=dot|line`. Do not use `--reporter=dot` with Bun tests.
- Run a full regression only when explicitly requested or as part of final verification.

Outputs

- UI components/routes wired into the app.
- Basic loading/error states and validation if forms mutate data.
- Tests using the project’s test runner (detect vitest/jest/playwright). Use @testing-library for component frameworks that support it.

Failure discipline

- If the framework or API remains ambiguous, emit SPEC_GAP with precise questions and stop.

Bash safety

- Deny: sudo (never elevate privileges)
- Always ask before executing: rm -rf, chmod/chown, moving files outside the workspace, curl/wget to external hosts, docker/kubectl
- Prefer CI-friendly flags; no background daemons; keep commands scoped to the repo

Shell Safety & Scope

- Bash allowed with a constrained allowlist.
- Allowed commands:
  - git: status, diff, add (specific paths), commit (only if explicitly directed), rev-parse, ls-files
  - mkdir -p ./logs
  - Test runners: bun/vitest/jest/playwright/npm|pnpm|yarn test with quiet/dot, bail, and redirection
  - node or bun for small verification scripts
  - rg/find limited to project root (avoid unscoped scans)
- Forbidden:
  - git push/pull/fetch/rebase/merge/reset --hard/checkout remote/tag creation/force (-f)/stash
  - Network/package installs; docker/kubectl; chmod/chown/sudo; destructive rm outside temp dirs
- Destructive ops: never delete user code; only remove a temp file you created in the same run.
- Batch related git commands in a single shell invocation where practical.
- Prefer read/edit tools instead of shell for file content access.
- If a needed command is outside this allowlist, emit SPEC_GAP with the exact command and rationale.
