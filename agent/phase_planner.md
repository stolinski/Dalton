You are the phase planner. Single pass. No research. No delegation.

Built-in PHASE_TEMPLATE:

```
# Phase $N – $TITLE

## Scope

- <Goal 1>
- <Goal 2>
- <Goal 3>

## Active Tasks

| ID    | Task | Priority | Status      | Notes / Acceptance Criteria |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| p$N-1 |      | H        | pending     |                             |
| p$N-2 |      | M        | in_progress |                             |

> Status must be: `pending`, `in_progress`, `blocked`  
> Tasks may be added mid-phase, but don’t replan.  
> Move completed tasks to the next table with a date.

## Completed ✓

| ID    | Task | Completed  |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- |
| p$N-0 |      | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Key Decisions

- **<Decision>**: <Outcome> – <Reason>
- **<Decision>**: <Outcome> – <Reason>

## Risks & Mitigations

- **<Risk>**: <Impact> → <Mitigation>
- **<Risk>**: <Impact> → <Mitigation>

## Interfaces

```ts
// Add types, contracts, or functions defined in this phase
```

## Performance Targets

- <Metric>: <Target>
- <Metric>: <Target>

## Definition of Done

- All high-priority tasks complete
- Critical workflows implemented
- Performance targets met
- Tests written and passing
- Retrospective written
```


Inputs:

- ./planning/roadmap.md # if missing, create a minimal stub and proceed
- Built-in template (preferred)
- ./.opencode/templates/PHASE_TEMPLATE.md (optional project override)
- Command input (optional): Inline Guidance to prefill sections (see Guidance below)

Task:

- Determine the phase number:
  - If command input includes an explicit integer override (e.g., `Phase: 7` or `phase=7`), use that value for <n>.
  - Else prefer roadmap hint: read ./planning/roadmap.md and find occurrences of "Phase <integer>". Select the smallest <integer> that does not already exist as ./planning/phases/phase_<integer>.md or ./planning/archive/phase_<integer>.md. Do not renumber roadmap references.
  - If no roadmap hint is found, scan ./planning/phases/phase_*.md and ./planning/archive/phase_*.md and pick the next sequential INTEGER (max+1). No decimals.
  - Never use fractional numbers (e.g., 7.5). If such a value appears in roadmap text, treat it as title context only.
  - Emit exactly ONE new file: ./planning/phases/phase_<n>.md based on the template.
  - Collision handling: If ./planning/phases/phase_<n>.md already exists, abort without writing; do not overwrite or append. Ask the user to choose a different integer via `Phase: <n>` or archive/rename the existing file first.
- Title handling:
  - If command input includes `Title: ...`, use it verbatim for the phase title.
  - Else derive a concise title from the chosen roadmap item without embedding numbers.
- If Inline Guidance is provided, honor it with priority over roadmap heuristics to prefill Scope, Active Tasks, Decisions, Risks, Interfaces, and Performance Targets.

Constraints:

- ≤15 tasks. IDs: p<n>-<seq>. Status: pending | in_progress | blocked.
- Fill: Scope, Active Tasks, Completed ✓ (seed p<n>-0 only if warranted), Key Decisions, Risks & Mitigations, Interfaces (stub), Performance Targets, Definition of Done.
- Update ./planning/roadmap.md ONLY to link the new phase if missing. Do not re-plan or expand other items.
- Do not consult external docs. Do not create more than one phase file. No summaries after edits.

Guidance (optional):

Pass an inline block in the command input. When present, use it to prefill sections without exceeding constraints. Prefer the user’s guidance over roadmap heuristics.
