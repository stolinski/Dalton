Built-in ENGINEERING_DECISIONS_TEMPLATE:

```
# Engineering Decisions

Purpose: Capture durable, project-wide choices with rationale and enforcement notes. Keep entries concise and actionable.

## How to Use
- Add a new entry per decision. Keep “Outcome” imperative and testable.
- Mirror critical active decisions in the current phase’s “Key Decisions”.
- Link to any enforcement (ESLint rules, CI checks, codegen, docs).
- Mark deprecated decisions and add their replacements.

## Decisions

Note: Example rows below are placeholders — remove in real projects.

| Decision | Outcome | Rationale | Scope | Status | Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Example — Naming (remove) | Use snake_case for variables | Consistent code style | Project | Example | ESLint rule |
| Example — Error handling (remove) | Centralized error handler with typed errors | Debuggability and safety | Project | Example | Middleware/logger |

## Fields
- Decision: Short name of the choice (e.g., “Data sync policy”).
- Outcome: The binding rule (e.g., “Use synced queries only”).
- Rationale: Why this is the right choice now.
- Scope: Project or Phase (if phase, also copy into phase Key Decisions).
- Status: Active, Deprecated, Proposed.
- Enforcement: Where this is checked (lint, CI, codegen, review).

## Notes
- Keep this document stable; avoid task-level detail.
- When a decision materially affects interfaces or performance, reflect it in the phase and in `.opencode/project.yaml` only if you want future automation to pick it up.
```

## Purpose

Set up the minimum project metadata needed for agents to adapt to the repo's tech stack and conventions.

## Tasks

1. **Check for `.opencode/project.yaml`**

   - If it exists, exit silently.
   - If not, create it based on:
     - `package.json` dependencies and scripts
     - `vite.config.*`, `svelte.config.*`, `next.config.*`, etc.
     - folder structure (`drizzle/`, `prisma/`, `src/server/`, etc.)

2. **Write `.opencode/project.yaml`**  
    Include:

   ```yaml
   web: svelte        # or react|vue|none
   server: node       # or bun|deno|none
   data: drizzle      # or prisma|knex|raw-sql|none
   tests: vitest      # or jest|playwright|none

   style:
     variables: snake_case
     fetch: native
   If a stack component is unknown, use none.
   ```

   - Use drizzle if drizzle/ or drizzle.config.\* is found.
   - Use svelte if svelte.config._ or +page._ is found.

3. Create these folders if missing:

   - planning/
   - planning/phases/
   - planning/archive/
   - lib_notes/

4. Create .gitkeep files in any folders above that are empty.

5. Only create `planning/engineering-decisions.md` if requested by the user or if the project contains explicit ADRs/decision docs to consolidate. When creating, use `./.opencode/templates/ENGINEERING_DECISIONS_TEMPLATE.md` if present; otherwise use a built-in minimal ADR template; as a last resort, check `./templates/ENGINEERING_DECISIONS_TEMPLATE.md`.

6. Log a gentle note if planning/roadmap.md is missing:

   - “planning/roadmap.md not found. You can create it manually or run /roadmap-phase-refresh next.”

## Output rules

- Do not modify any files besides `.opencode/project.yaml`, created folders, and `.gitkeep` placeholders.
- Do not run `/roadmap-phase-refresh`, create phase files, or emit summaries.
- Only write if something is missing or ambiguous.

## Implementation notes

- Use safe shell ops when allowed:
  - `mkdir -p` for folder creation
  - `touch` for `.gitkeep` inside newly created or empty folders (skip `.opencode/templates/`)
- Keep all writes scoped to the repository root; never leave the workspace.
