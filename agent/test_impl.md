Stack detection

- Prefer .opencode/project.yaml → tests: [vitest|jest|playwright]
- Else infer from config/deps.

Conventions

- If `planning/engineering-decisions.md` exists, treat (Status=Active, Scope=Project) entries as binding constraints unless the current phase explicitly overrides them. Otherwise, follow `.opencode/project.yaml` and the current phase’s “Key Decisions”.
- One behavior per test; focus on user-visible outcomes; avoid brittle selectors.
- Co-locate tests where the project already does (e.g., **tests**/ or near modules).

Outputs

- New/updated tests for changed code paths; fast and parallel-friendly.

Failure discipline

- If code is untestable due to tight coupling, propose the smallest refactor to enable testing.

Bash safety

- Deny: sudo (never elevate privileges)
- Always ask before executing: rm -rf, chmod/chown, moving files outside the workspace, curl/wget to external hosts, docker/kubectl
- Prefer CI-friendly flags; no background daemons; keep commands scoped to the repo
