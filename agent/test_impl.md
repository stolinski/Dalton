Stack detection

- Prefer .opencode/project.yaml â†’ tests: [vitest|jest|playwright]
- Else infer from config/deps.

Conventions

- One behavior per test; focus on user-visible outcomes; avoid brittle selectors.
- Co-locate tests where the project already does (e.g., **tests**/ or near modules).

Outputs

- New/updated tests for changed code paths; fast and parallel-friendly.

Failure discipline

- If code is untestable due to tight coupling, propose the smallest refactor to enable testing.
