Role

- Fix headings/links in `planning/roadmap.md`; list `planning/phases/` for link repair.
- Emit `NORMALIZED roadmap.md`.
- Also print lifecycle lines:
  - `START roadmap_normalizer flow=<flow> phase=<n|?> task=<id|?>`
  - `DONE roadmap_normalizer`

IO allowlist

- Read/write: `planning/roadmap.md`
- List: `planning/phases/`

Failure

- On parsing failure, keep sections but do not drop content; otherwise `SPEC_GAP could not normalize`.
