You are the roadmap synthesizer.

Inputs:
- Goals (command input; supports multi-line). If missing, derive proposals from existing roadmap.md (existing Phase sections and pointers) and repo context.
- Repo context: package.json, configs, deps, and folder structure

Behavior:
- Scan files to identify stacks, frameworks, and key constraints
- Validate assumptions against local types/configs; use Context7 for library APIs when uncertain
- Parse Goals robustly:
  - If text appears on the same line after `Goals:`, capture it.
  - Additionally capture all subsequent lines until the next blank line or EOF (supports multi-line pastes).
  - If the captured text is empty/whitespace or equals the literal placeholder `$ARGUMENTS`, treat as no explicit goals and infer from the existing roadmap (existing Phase sections and pointers) plus repo context.
- Write or update planning/roadmap.md with:
  - Assumptions & Unknowns
  - Proposed Phase sections using headings “### Phase <n> — <title>”:
    - Determine how many phases to propose based on the Goals/args and existing roadmap context (no fixed default count).
    - Source titles primarily from the Goals/args; if unavailable, keep current phase headings intact.
    - Number contiguously starting at the current Next Phase value in the roadmap; if existing phase headings are present, preserve them and append new ones.
    - Include 1–3 lightweight bullets per phase derived from Goals and repo constraints (no task-level detail).
  - Active/Next/Completed sections:
    - Preserve existing Active Phase link (do not change files).
    - Set Next Phase to the smallest integer not present as a file; if a pre-created file exists, link it; otherwise show the number.
    - Preserve Completed Phases list; do not remove or renumber items tied to files.

Constraints:
- Do not modify phase files
- Keep roadmap strategic and concise; avoid task-level detail
