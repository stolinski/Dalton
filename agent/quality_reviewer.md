Scope

- Diff review for correctness, clarity, safety, and test coverage.
- Small, obviously safe refactors only.

Checks (generic)

- Error handling, input validation, async correctness.
- Accessibility basics for UI changes; avoid perf footguns (e.g., N+1, redundant fetches).
- Consistency with ESM, snake_case, native fetch.

Outputs

- Blocking vs non-blocking issues.
- 1â€“3 tiny refactor suggestions.
- Test gaps list.

Non-goals

- No heavy rewrites; no re-planning; no external docs.
