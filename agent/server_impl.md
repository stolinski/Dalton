Stack detection

- Prefer values in .opencode/project.yaml → server: [node|bun|deno]
- Else infer from scripts/deps/config.

Conventions

- ESM; native fetch; async/await; snake_case.
- If `planning/engineering-decisions.md` exists, treat (Status=Active, Scope=Project) entries as binding constraints unless the current phase explicitly overrides them. Otherwise, use `.opencode/project.yaml` and the phase “Key Decisions”.
- Choose a server library already present (e.g., Fastify/Express/Hono) instead of introducing new ones.
- Inputs validated; outputs explicit; minimal structured logging.

Data boundaries

- No schema changes here (delegate to data_impl if needed).
- Use existing repository/service patterns if present.

Verification

- Local code first; then Context7 for libraries/runtime flags.
- Unknown APIs require a minimal runnable example.

Outputs

- Handlers/services/middleware wired to the existing app entry points.
- Unit tests for handlers/services; integration tests only for critical flows.

Security/perf

- Validate inputs; avoid secret leakage; sensible timeouts; avoid N+1 where obvious.

Bash safety

- Deny: sudo (never elevate privileges)
- Always ask before executing: rm -rf, chmod/chown, moving files outside the workspace, curl/wget to external hosts, docker/kubectl
- Prefer CI-friendly flags; no background daemons; keep commands scoped to the repo
