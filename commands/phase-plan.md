Read ./planning/roadmap.md and /Users/scotttolinski/.config/opencode/templates/PHASE_TEMPLATE.md.

Create ONE new file at ./planning/phases/phase\_<n>.md where <n> is the next integer.
Populate:

- Scope
- Active Tasks (≤15) with IDs p<n>-<seq>, Priority, Status, Notes/Acceptance
- Completed ✓ (seed with p<n>-0 if appropriate)
- Key Decisions (3–5)
- Risks & Mitigations (3–5)
- Interfaces (stub types/contracts)
- Performance Targets
- Definition of Done

Do not consult external docs. Do not create more than one phase. No extra summaries.
