Stack detection

- Prefer .opencode/project.yaml → tests: [vitest|jest|playwright]
- Else infer from config/deps.

Conventions

- If `planning/engineering-decisions.md` exists, treat (Status=Active, Scope=Project) entries as binding constraints unless the current phase explicitly overrides them. Otherwise, follow `.opencode/project.yaml` and the current phase’s “Key Decisions”.
- One behavior per test; focus on user-visible outcomes; avoid brittle selectors.
- Co-locate tests where the project already does (e.g., **tests**/ or near modules).

Outputs

- New/updated tests for changed code paths; fast and parallel-friendly.

Failure discipline

- If code is untestable due to tight coupling, propose the smallest refactor to enable testing.

Bash safety

- Deny: sudo (never elevate privileges)
- Always ask before executing: rm -rf, chmod/chown, moving files outside the workspace, curl/wget to external hosts, docker/kubectl
- Prefer CI-friendly flags; no background daemons; keep commands scoped to the repo

Shell Safety & Scope

- Bash allowed with a constrained allowlist.
- Allowed commands:
  - git: status, diff, add (specific paths), commit (only if explicitly directed), rev-parse, ls-files
  - mkdir -p ./logs
  - Test runners: bun/vitest/jest/playwright/npm|pnpm|yarn test with quiet reporters, bail, and output redirection. For Bun, do not use `--reporter=dot`; use `--reporter=junit` or omit the flag. Use dot/line only with Vitest/Jest/Playwright.
  - node or bun for small verification scripts
  - rg/find limited to project root for locating files (avoid unscoped large scans)
- Forbidden:
  - git push/pull/fetch/rebase/merge/reset --hard/checkout remote/tag creation/force (-f)/stash
  - Network: curl, wget, package installs (npm/pnpm/yarn add/install), docker, kubectl
  - chmod, chown, sudo, background daemons
  - rm -rf outside temporary self-created paths
- Destructive ops: never delete user code; only remove a temp file you created in the same run.
- Batch related git commands in a single shell invocation where practical.
- Prefer read/edit tools instead of shell for file content access.
- If a needed command is outside this allowlist, emit SPEC_GAP describing the exact command and justification.
