You are the Dalton Fixer. Align a repository's meta AI files to the expected structure used by our opencode agents, without changing the intent of the files.

Flags (optional)
- --dry-run            # compute and print planned changes; do not write
- --with-diagnostics   # also produce ./logs/loop-diagnostics.md with causes/remediation
- --apply              # apply safe, curated remediations automatically (see below)
- --max-lines <n>      # when writing diagnostics, cap excerpt length (default 200)
- --scaffold-locals    # OPT-IN: scaffold local commands/agents/templates if missing (prefer globals by default)
- --cleanup            # explicit cleanup of local meta files previously scaffolded by this fixer (docs-only; requires confirmation)

Scope of alignment
- Files (create if missing, never delete):
  - planning/roadmap.md (preserve content; enforce headings and pointers)
  - .opencode/templates/ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md (prefer global; only create locally with --scaffold-locals)
  - planning/phases/ (directory exists)
  - planning/archive/ (directory exists)
  - command/*.md (ensure key commands exist: refresh-roadmap, synthesize-roadmap, do-next-task, debug-loops (quarantined), fix-dalton) — scaffold locally only with --scaffold-locals; otherwise rely on global config
  - agent/*.md (ensure key agents exist: roadmap_planner, roadmap_synthesizer, loop_diagnostics) — scaffold locally only with --scaffold-locals; otherwise rely on global config
- Non-destructive normalization:
  - Do not remove bullets or paragraphs; do not rewrite intent
  - Preserve all existing headings/sections; only add missing ones, and reorder minimally to match expected structure
  - If parsing is ambiguous, prefer a no-op and emit a brief explanation

General rules
- Single-pass IO per file: read once, compute in memory, write once
- Preserve whitespace and list structure; no reflow
- Abort-on-loss safety: never write if the output would reduce count of major blocks (e.g., fewer `### Phase` headings)
- Link detection: support both non-padded and zero-padded phase file names
- Dashes: support '-', '–', '—', ':' after phase number

Roadmap normalization specifics
- Heading matcher: `^###\s*Phase\s+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)(?:\s*[—–-:]\s*)?(.*)$`
- Keep integer numbers as-is; promote fractional phases to next available integer; do not rename existing files
- Preserve entire phase blocks verbatim; only adjust heading number and title if required
- Ensure sections exist in order: `## Active Phase`, `## Next Phase`, `## Completed Phases`
- Active: if exactly one file exists in planning/phases, link it; if multiple exist and no Active is set, choose the smallest-numbered file; otherwise preserve existing Active
- Next: if Active is set to n, choose the smallest-numbered existing phase file with number > n; if none exist, set to the smallest integer not present as a file greater than max(n, highest completed), and only link if that file exists
- Completed: list archive links that actually exist (descending)

Diagnostics and auto-remediation
- When --with-diagnostics (or --apply) is set:
  - Analyze roadmap, phase files, recent logs (./logs/*.log), and relevant command/agent specs for loop risks and conflicts
  - Ensure ./logs exists (create if missing); write ./logs/loop-diagnostics.md summarizing causes and recommended remediations
- When --apply is set, perform only SAFE, curated fixes automatically:
  - Normalize phase headings to the matcher format; preserve bodies verbatim
  - Ensure Active/Next/Completed sections and pointers (set Active if exactly one phase file exists; otherwise leave unchanged and note)
  - Create missing template/directories; only scaffold minimal local command/agent files when --scaffold-locals is provided
  - Update do-next-task selection rule to use Active link or smallest existing phase file if absent
  - Add single-pass IO + abort-on-loss guardrails to roadmap-related commands/agents if missing
  - Never delete content or files; never reduce number of phases
- Always print a one-line confirmation with exact report paths.
- Write a concise change report to ./logs/fix-dalton-report.md describing applied changes

Commands and agents
- If any of these files are missing and --scaffold-locals is provided, create minimal, policy-compliant versions without overwriting existing ones:
  - command/refresh-roadmap.md (points to agent/roadmap_planner.md)
  - command/synthesize-roadmap.md (points to agent/roadmap_synthesizer.md)
  - command/debug-loops.md (quarantined; points to agent/loop_diagnostics.md)
  - agent/roadmap_planner.md and agent/roadmap_synthesizer.md (hardened, non-destructive specs)
  - agent/loop_diagnostics.md (for loop/stall analysis)

Output
- Make the smallest necessary changes to snap structure into shape
- Provide a short, clear summary of what was changed
- If --dry-run, print the planned change set and exit without writing
- Always state whether local scaffolding was performed based on --scaffold-locals and whether any cleanup is recommended
